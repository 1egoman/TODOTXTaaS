My Hack Upstate Idea

Basically, write an app to fix the dropbox syncing problem of todo.txt. 
The idea is to write a service that has standard CRUD operations for each item, and integrates well
with todo.txt projects and contexts. Also, there probably should be a frontend of some sort for the 
whole thing, ala bootstrap.
